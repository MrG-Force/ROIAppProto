# ROI HR Contacts App
A React Native App for managing the contact information of people who works in the company.


## 1. All Contacts Screen (Home)
- On start up, the app will display a list of all the contacts. Each record is displayed inside a card with the contactâ€™s **name** and **phone number**.
- On top of the list you will see two text inputs. One allows you two search a user by **name** and the other by the employee's **Id** number.
- Bellow the two search inputs there is a drop-down list that will filter the list by the selected ROI department.
- In the right top corner of the screen, inside the header. There is a button to add a new contact to the list.

## 2.	Search by name
- To search for a user by her/his name, start typing the name in the text field, the app will automatically filter the contacts list as you type.

## 3.	Search by Id
- If you know the **Employee Id Number** of a specific Contact, just type it in the **Id search field** and **press enter** in the keyboard.
- If a Contact with that Id exists, the app will take you to the details page or will display a message if the contact was not found.

## 4.	Filter by department
- To see all the contacts in a Department, select the department from the drop-down list and press the filter button(funnel).

## 5.	Add Contact
- When the Add contact  button is pressed you will be taken to the **New Contact** page. Here you can add a new contact by filling the required fields. ***Note that all fields are required.*** If some field is missing, the app will display an error message.
- To save the contact simply press the **Add contact** button at the bottom of the screen. If everything went fine, a success message will be displayed. 
- In the unlikely event of a network failure a message will appear with details of the error.

## 6.	Contact details
- You can easily navigate to the contactâ€™s details page by pressing the green arrow on the right side of the contactâ€™s card.

## 7.	Details Screen

## 8.	Deleting a Contact

A message will appear to confirm the operation. *Note that it might take a few moments for the contact to disappear from the contacts list in the home screen.*

## 9.	Editing a Contact

And that's pretty much it... cruisy ðŸ¤˜ :grin:
